description: "samtools merge [-nur1f] [-h inh.sam] [-t tag] [-R reg] [-b list] out.bam\
  \ in1.bam [in2.bam in3.bam ... inN.bam]\nMerge multiple sorted alignment files,\
  \ producing a single sorted output file that contains all the input records and\
  \ maintains the existing sort order.\nIf -h is specified the @SQ headers of input\
  \ files will be merged into the specified header, otherwise they will be merged\
  \ into a composite header created from the input headers. If the @SQ headers differ\
  \ in order this may require the output file to be re-sorted after merge.\nThe ordering\
  \ of the records in the input files must match the usage of the -n and -t command-line\
  \ options. If they do not, the output order will be undefined. See sort for information\
  \ about record ordering."
