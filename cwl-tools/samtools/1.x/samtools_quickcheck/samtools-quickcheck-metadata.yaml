description: "samtools quickcheck [options] in.sam|in.bam|in.cram [ ... ]\nQuickly\
  \ check that input files appear to be intact. Checks that beginning of the file\
  \ contains a valid header (all formats) containing at least one target sequence\
  \ and then seeks to the end of the file and checks that an end-of-file (EOF) is\
  \ present and intact (BAM only).\nData in the middle of the file is not read since\
  \ that would be much more time consuming, so please note that this command will\
  \ not detect internal corruption, but is useful for testing that files are not truncated\
  \ before performing more intensive tasks on them.\nThis command will exit with a\
  \ non-zero exit code if any input files don't have a valid header or are missing\
  \ an EOF block. Otherwise it will exit successfully (with a zero exit code)."
