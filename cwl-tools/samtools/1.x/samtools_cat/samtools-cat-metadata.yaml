description: "samtools cat [-b list] [-h header.sam] [-o out.bam] in1.bam in2.bam\
  \ [ ... ]\nConcatenate BAMs or CRAMs. Although this works on either BAM or CRAM,\
  \ all input files must be the same format as each other. The sequence dictionary\
  \ of each input file must be identical, although this command does not check this.\
  \ This command uses a similar trick to reheader which enables fast BAM concatenation."
