description: Similar to merge, cluster report each set of overlapping or “book-ended”
  features in an interval file. In contrast to merge, cluster does not flatten the
  cluster of intervals into a new meta-interval; instead, it assigns an unique cluster
  ID to each record in each cluster. This is useful for having fine control over how
  sets of overlapping intervals in a single interval file are combined.
