description: The bedtools coverage tool computes both the depth and breadth of coverage
  of features in file B on the features in file A. For example, bedtools coverage
  can compute the coverage of sequence alignments (file B) across 1 kilobase (arbitrary)
  windows (file A) tiling a genome of interest. One advantage that bedtools coverage
  offers is that it not only counts the number of features that overlap an interval
  in file A, it also computes the fraction of bases in the interval in A that were
  overlapped by one or more features. Thus, bedtools coverage also computes the breadth
  of coverage observed for each interval in A.
