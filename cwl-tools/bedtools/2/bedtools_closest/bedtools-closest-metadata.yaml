  Similar to intersect, closest searches for overlapping features in A and B.
  In the event that no feature in B overlaps the current feature in A, closest will report the nearest (that is, least genomic distance from the start or end of A) feature in B.
  For example, one might want to find which is the closest gene to a significant GWAS polymorphism.
  Note that closest will report an overlapping feature as the closest—that is, it does not restrict to closest non-overlapping feature.
