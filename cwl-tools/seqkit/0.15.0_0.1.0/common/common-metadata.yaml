description: FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide
  and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting,
  searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing
  tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently,
  and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated
  installation process of required packages and running environments can render these
  programs less user friendly. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution
  time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of
  SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.
