description: "sambamba index builds an index for a sorted by coordinate BAM file.\
  \ This step is required for effective region querying in most tools for working\
  \ with BAM data.\nAn index is by default written to the file with the same filename\
  \ except .bai extension added to the end. The user can, however, override this default\
  \ by providing desired output filename explicitly as an optional command-line argument."
