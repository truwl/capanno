description:  >
  In this step user supplies the genome files generated in the 1st step, as well as the RNA-seq
  reads (sequences) in the form of FASTA or FASTQ files. STAR maps the reads to the genome,
  and writes several output files, such as alignments (SAM/BAM), mapping summary statistics,
  splice junctions, unmapped reads, signal (wiggle) tracks etc.
