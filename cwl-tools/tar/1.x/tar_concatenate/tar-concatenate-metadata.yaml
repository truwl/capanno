description: "-A, --catenate, --concatenate\nAppend archive to the end of another\
  \ archive. The arguments are treated as the names of archives to append. All archives\
  \ must be of the same format as the archive they are appended to, otherwise the\
  \ resulting archive might be unusable with non-GNU  implementations of tar. Notice\
  \ also that when more than one archive is given, the members from archives other\
  \ than the first one will be accessible in the resulting archive only if using the\
  \ -i (--ignore-zeros) option.\nCompressed archives cannot be concatenated."
