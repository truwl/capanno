description: "sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text\nSed  is a stream\
  \ editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input\
  \ stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor\
  \ which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over\
  \ the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter\
  \ text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors."
