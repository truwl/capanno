description: "Chart the distribution of quality scores.\nThis tool is used for determining\
  \ the overall 'quality' for a library in a given run. To that effect, it outputs\
  \ a chart and tables indicating the range of quality scores and the total numbers\
  \ of bases corresponding to those scores. Options include plotting the distribution\
  \ of all of the reads, only the aligned reads, or reads that have passed the Illumina\
  \ Chastity filter thresholds as described here.\nNote on base quality score options\n\
  If the quality score of read bases has been modified in a previous data processing\
  \ step such as GATK Base Recalibration and an OQ tag is available, this tool can\
  \ be set to plot the OQ value as well as the primary quality value for the evaluation.\
  \ Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
