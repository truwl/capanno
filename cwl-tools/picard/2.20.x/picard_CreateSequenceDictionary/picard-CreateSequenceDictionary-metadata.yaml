description: "Creates a sequence dictionary for a reference sequence. This tool creates\
  \ a sequence dictionary file (with \".dict\" extension) from a reference sequence\
  \ provided in FASTA format, which is required by many processing and analysis tools.\
  \ The output file contains a header but no SAMRecords, and the header contains only\
  \ sequence records.\nThe reference sequence can be gzipped (both .fasta and .fasta.gz\
  \ are supported)."
