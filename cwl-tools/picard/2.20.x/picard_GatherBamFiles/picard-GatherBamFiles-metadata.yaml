description: "Concatenate one or more BAM files as efficiently as possibleThis tool\
  \ performs a rapid \"gather\" operation on BAM files after scatter operations where\
  \ the same process has been performed on different regions of a BAM file creating\
  \ many smaller BAM files that now need to be concatenated (reassembled) back together.\n\
  Assumes that the list of BAM files provided as INPUT are in the order that they\
  \ should be concatenated and simply concatenates the bodies of the BAM files while\
  \ retaining the header from the first file. Operates via copying of the gzip blocks\
  \ directly for speed but also supports generation of an MD5 on the output and indexing\
  \ of the output BAM file. Only supports BAM files, does not support SAM files."
