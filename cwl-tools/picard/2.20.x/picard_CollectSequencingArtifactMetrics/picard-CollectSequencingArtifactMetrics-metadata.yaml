description: "Collect metrics to quantify single-base sequencing artifacts.\nThis\
  \ tool examines two sources of sequencing errors associated with hybrid selection\
  \ protocols. These errors are divided into two broad categories, pre-adapter and\
  \ bait-bias. Pre-adapter errors can arise from laboratory manipulations of a nucleic\
  \ acid sample e.g. shearing and occur prior to the ligation of adapters for PCR\
  \ amplification (hence the name pre-adapter).\nBait-bias artifacts occur during\
  \ or after the target selection step, and correlate with substitution rates that\
  \ are 'biased', or higher for sites having one base on the reference/positive strand\
  \ relative to sites having the complementary base on that strand. For example, during\
  \ the target selection step, a (G>T) artifact might result in a higher substitution\
  \ rate at sites with a G on the positive strand (and C on the negative), relative\
  \ to sites with the flip (C positive)/(G negative). This is known as the 'G-Ref'\
  \ artifact.\nFor additional information on these types of artifacts, please see\
  \ the corresponding GATK dictionary entries on bait-bias and pre-adapter artifacts.\n\
  This tool produces four files; summary and detail metrics files for both pre-adapter\
  \ and bait-bias artifacts. The detailed metrics show the error rates for each type\
  \ of base substitution within every possible triplet base configuration. Error rates\
  \ associated with these substitutions are Phred-scaled and provided as quality scores,\
  \ the lower the value, the more likely it is that an alternate base call is due\
  \ to an artifact. The summary metrics provide likelihood information on the 'worst-case'\
  \ errors."
