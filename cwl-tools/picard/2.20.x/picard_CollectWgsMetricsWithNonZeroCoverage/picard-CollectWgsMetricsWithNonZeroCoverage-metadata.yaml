description: "Collect metrics about coverage and performance of whole genome sequencing\
  \ (WGS) experiments. This tool collects metrics about the percentages of reads that\
  \ pass base- and mapping- quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels.\
  \ Both minimum base- and mapping-quality values as well as the maximum read depths\
  \ (coverage cap) are user defined. This extends CollectWgsMetrics by including metrics\
  \ related only to siteswith non-zero (>0) coverage.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages\
  \ are actually expressed as fractions!"
