description: "Collect whole genome sequencing-related metrics. This tool computes\
  \ metrics that are useful for evaluating coverage and performance of whole genome\
  \ sequencing experiments. These metrics include the percentages of reads that pass\
  \ minimal base- and mapping- quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels.\n\
  The histogram output is optional and for a given run, displays two separate outputs\
  \ on the y-axis while using a single set of values for the x-axis. Specifically,\
  \ the first column in the histogram table (x-axis) is labeled 'coverage' and represents\
  \ different possible coverage depths. However, it also represents the range of values\
  \ for the base quality scores and thus should probably be labeled 'sequence depth\
  \ and base quality scores'. The second and third columns (y-axes) correspond to\
  \ the numbers of bases at a specific sequence depth 'count' and the numbers of bases\
  \ at a particular base quality score 'baseq_count' respectively.\nAlthough similar\
  \ to the CollectWgsMetrics tool, the default thresholds for CollectRawWgsMetrics\
  \ are less stringent. For example, the CollectRawWgsMetrics have base and mapping\
  \ quality score thresholds set to '3' and '0' respectively, while the CollectWgsMetrics\
  \ tool has the default threshold values set to '20' (at time of writing). Nevertheless,\
  \ both tools enable the user to input specific threshold values.\nNote: Metrics\
  \ labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
