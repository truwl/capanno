description: "Designs oligonucleotide baits for hybrid selection reactions.\nThis\
  \ tool is used to design custom bait sets for hybrid selection experiments. The\
  \ following files are input into BaitDesigner: a (TARGET) interval list indicating\
  \ the sequences of interest, e.g. exons with their respective coordinates, a reference\
  \ sequence, and a unique identifier string (DESIGN_NAME).\nThe tool will output\
  \ interval_list files of both bait and target sequences as well as the actual bait\
  \ sequences in FastA format. At least two baits are output for each target sequence,\
  \ with greater numbers for larger intervals. Although the default values for both\
  \ bait size (120 bases) nd offsets (80 bases) are suitable for most applications,\
  \ these values can be customized. Offsets represent the distance between sequential\
  \ baits on a contiguous stretch of target DNA sequence.\nThe tool will also output\
  \ a pooled set of 55,000 (default) oligonucleotides representing all of the baits\
  \ redundantly. This redundancy achieves a uniform concentration of oligonucleotides\
  \ for synthesis by a vendor as well as equal numbersof each bait to prevent bias\
  \ during the hybrid selection reaction."
