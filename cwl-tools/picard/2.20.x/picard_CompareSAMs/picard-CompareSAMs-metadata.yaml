description: 'Compare two input ".sam" or ".bam" files. This tool initially compares
  the headers of SAM or BAM files. If the file headers are comparable, the tool will
  examine and compare readUnmapped flag, reference name, start position and strand
  between the SAMRecords. The tool summarizes information on the number of read pairs
  that match or mismatch, and of reads that are missing or unmapped (stratified by
  direction: forward or reverse).'
