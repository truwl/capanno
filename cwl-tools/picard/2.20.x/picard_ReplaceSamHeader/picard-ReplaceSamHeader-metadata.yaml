description: "Replaces the SAMFileHeader in a SAM or BAM file. This tool makes it\
  \ possible to replace the header of a SAM or BAM file with the header of anotherfile,\
  \ or a header block that has been edited manually (in a stub SAM file). The sort\
  \ order (@SO) of the two input files must be the same.\nNote that validation is\
  \ minimal, so it is up to the user to ensure that all the elements referred to in\
  \ the SAMRecords are present in the new header."
