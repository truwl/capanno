description: >-
  Creates a sequence dictionary for a reference sequence. This tool creates a sequence dictionary file (with ".dict" extension) from a reference sequence provided in FASTA format, which is required by many processing and analysis tools.
  The output file contains a header but no SAMRecords, and the header contains only sequence records.

  The reference sequence can be gzipped (both .fasta and .fasta.gz are supported).
