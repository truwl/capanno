  Calculate PCR-related metrics from targeted sequencing data.

  This tool calculates a set of PCR-related metrics from an aligned SAM or BAM file containing targeted sequencing data.
  It is appropriate for data produced with multiple small-target technologies including exome sequencing an custom amplicon panels such as the Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) kit.

  If a reference sequence is provided, AT/GC dropout metrics will be calculated and the PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option can be used to output GC content and mean coverage information for each target.
  The AT/GC dropout metrics indicate the degree of inadequate coverage of a particular region based on its AT or GC content. The PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option can be used to output GC content and mean sequence depth information for every target interval.

  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!
