  Collect multiple classes of metrics.
  This 'meta-metrics' tool runs one or more of the metrics collection modules at the same time to cut down on the time spent reading in data from input files.
  Available modules include CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics, CollectInsertSizeMetrics, QualityScoreDistribution, MeanQualityByCycle, CollectBaseDistributionByCycle, CollectGcBiasMetrics, RnaSeqMetrics, CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics, and CollectQualityYieldMetrics.
  The tool produces outputs of '.pdf' and '.txt' files for each module, except for the CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics module, which outputs only a '.txt' file.
  Output files are named by specifying a base name (without any file extensions).

  Currently all programs are run with default options and fixed output extensions, but this may become more flexible in future. Specifying a reference sequence file is required.

  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!
