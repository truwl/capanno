  mirna_seq_pipeline.fastqs:
    description: A list of lists of input fastq files, one for each replicate. Typically the sublists contain only one element, except in the case when each replicate consists of multiple technical replicates represented by separate gzipped fastq files.
    example: [
      ["gs://mirna-seq-pipeline/inputs/ENCSR569QVM/ENCFF119JCH_rep1.fastq.gz"],
      ["gs://mirna-seq-pipeline/inputs/ENCSR569QVM/ENCFF756CSN_rep2.fastq.gz"]
    ]

  mirna_seq_pipeline.five_prime_adapters:
    description: Is a list of lists of 5' adapter fasta files, one for each replicate.
    help: "Note: structure of this list should correspond to the structure of mirna_seq_pipeline.fastqs. Typically the sublists contain only one element, except in the case when each replicate consists of multiple technical replicates. Note that even in the case where all the techical replicates use same 5' adapters, the same file name needs to be repeated as many times as there are technical replicates."
    example: [
      ["gs://mirna-seq-pipeline/full_sized_reference_files/adapters/five_prime_adapter_set3.fasta"], 
      ["gs://mirna-seq-pipeline/full_sized_reference_files/adapters/five_prime_adapter_set4.fasta"]
