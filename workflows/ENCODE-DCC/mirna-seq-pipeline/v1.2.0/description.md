This is the ENCODE-DCC Micro RNA-sequencing pipeline. The scope of the pipeline is to cut adapters, align reads, generate signal tracks, and quantify genes.

MicroRNA-seq allows researchers to characterize and quantify the expression and prevalence of the small non-coding RNA moleccules known as microRNA. These molecules may play an important role in diseases, and significant effort is underway to understand their effects across a variety of tissue types and cells. For effective processing, the average insert size must be no more than 30 bases.
