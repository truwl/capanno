This is the ENCODE-DCC RNA-sequencing pipeline. The scope of the pipeline is to align reads, generate signal tracks, and quantify genes and isoforms.

RNA-seq data is valuable as it allows the measure of RNA expression levels as a transcriptional readout and the study of RNA structures in order to understand how RNA-based mechanisms impact gene regulation and thus disease and phenotypic variation.

#### Job Costs
Costs for this workflow typically vary between $10-$25 per job and depends mostly on the size and number of replicates.

Examples:
