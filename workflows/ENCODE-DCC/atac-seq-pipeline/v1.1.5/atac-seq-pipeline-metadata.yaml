#  Files are defined in single fastqs file, not fastqs_rep1_R1, etc.

name: ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline
identifier: WF_e85df4.f7
description: |
  The prototype ATAC-seq pipeline was developed by Anshul Kundaje's lab at Stanford University. Upon revision and
  full implementation, it will be a part of the ENCODE Uniform Processing Pipelines series. The full ATAC-seq
  pipeline code is available on Github.

  The ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline is used for quality control and statistical signal processing of short-read sequencing
   data, producing alignments and measures of enrichment.

  The pipeline shown here assumes the following defaults: align_only is false, pipeline_type is 'atac', all fastq and adapter
  files are defined in a single files, true_rep_only is false, disable_xcor is false, disable_ataqc is false,
  enable_idr is true (false is the default value, but set to true so all the possible steps are shown).
