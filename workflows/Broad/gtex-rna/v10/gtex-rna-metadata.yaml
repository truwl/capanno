description: >
  This repository contains all components of the RNA-seq pipeline used by the GTEx Consortium, including alignment, expression quantification, and quality control.

  SamToFastq: BAM to FASTQ conversion
  STAR: spliced alignment of RNA sequence reads (v2.5.3a)
  Picard MarkDuplicates: mark duplicate reads
  RSEM transcript expression quantification (v1.3.0)
  bamsync: utility for transferring QC flags from the input BAM and for re-generating read group IDs
  RNA-SeQC: QC metrics and gene-level expression quantification (v1.1.9)

  Reference indexes for STAR and RSEM are needed to run the pipeline. All reference files are available at gs://gtex-resources.

  GTEx releases from V8 onward are based on the GRCh38/hg38 reference genome. Please see [TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md) for details and links for this reference. Releases up to V7 were based on the GRCh37/hg19 reference genome (download).

  For hg19-based analyses, the GENCODE annotation should be patched to use Ensembl chromosome names:

  zcat gencode.v19.annotation.gtf.gz | \
      sed 's/chrM/chrMT/;s/chr//' > gencode.v19.annotation.patched_contigs.gtf

  A 2x76 bp paired-end sequencing protocol, will use a sjdbOverhang of 75
