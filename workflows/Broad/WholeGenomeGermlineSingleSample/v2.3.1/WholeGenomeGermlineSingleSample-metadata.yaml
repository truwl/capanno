name: Broad WGS Single Sample pipeline
identifier: WF_63e0c3.bc
description: >
  This WDL pipeline implements data pre-processing and initial variant calling (GVCF
  generation) according to the GATK Best Practices (June 2016) for germline SNP and
  Indel discovery in human whole-genome data

  Requirements/expectations :
  - Human whole-genome pair-end sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format
  - One or more read groups, one per uBAM file, all belonging to a single sample (SM)
  - Input uBAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements
  - - filenames all have the same suffix (we use ".unmapped.bam")
  - - files must pass validation by ValidateSamFile
  - - reads are provided in query-sorted order
  - - all reads must have an RG tag
  - GVCF output names must end in ".g.vcf.gz"
  - Reference genome must be Hg38 with ALT contigs
