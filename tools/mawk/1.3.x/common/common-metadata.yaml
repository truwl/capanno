description: "mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK language\
  \ is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and processing, and for\
  \ prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. mawk is a new awk meaning it implements\
  \ the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming\
  \ Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988 (hereafter referred to as the AWK book.)\
  \ mawk conforms to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language\
  \ which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk provides\
  \ a small number of extensions.\nAn AWK program is a sequence of pattern {action}\
  \ pairs and function definitions. Short programs are entered on the command line\
  \ usually enclosed in ' ' to avoid shell interpretation. Longer programs can be\
  \ read in from a file with the -f option. Data input is read from the list of files\
  \ on the command line or from standard input when the list is empty. The input is\
  \ broken into records as determined by the record separator variable, RS. Initially,\
  \ RS = \"\\n\" and records are synonymous with lines. Each record is compared against\
  \ each pattern and if it matches, the program text for {action} is executed."
