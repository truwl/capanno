description: ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
  sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real sequencing process
  with empirical error models or quality profiles summarized from large recalibrated
  sequencing data. ART can also simulate reads using user own read error model or
  quality profiles. ART supports simulation of single-end, paired-end/mate-pair reads
  of three major commercial next-generation sequencing platforms. Illuminas Solexa,
  Roches 454 and Applied Biosystems SOLiD
