description: "Model-based Analysis of ChIP-seq data.\nWith the improvement of sequencing\
  \ techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing\
  \ (ChIP-Seq) is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To\
  \ address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we presented the Model-based\
  \ Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for identifying transcript factor binding sites.\
  \ MACS captures the influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance\
  \ of enriched ChIP regions and MACS improves the spatial resolution of binding sites\
  \ through combining the information of both sequencing tag position and orientation.\
  \ MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data alone, or with a control sample with\
  \ the increase of specificity. Moreover, as a general peak-caller, MACS can also\
  \ be applied to any “DNA enrichment assays” if the question to be asked is simply:\
  \ where we can find significant reads coverage than the random background."
