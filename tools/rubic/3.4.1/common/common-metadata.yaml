description: RUBIC detects recurrent copy number aberrations using copy number breaks,
  rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This allows for a vastly simplified
  approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and repeated re-estimation of the
  background model are avoided. Furthermore, the false discovery rate is controlled
  on the level of called regions, rather than at the probe level.
