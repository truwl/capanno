description: "BAM files can have either 'coordinate' sort order, or 'qname' one.\n\
  The first one means to sort the file by (integer) reference ID, and for each reference\
  \ sort corresponding reads by start coordinate.\n'qname' sorting order is when reads\
  \ are sorted lexicographically by their names.\nsambamba sort does an external sort\
  \ on input file. That means it reads the source BAM file in chunks that fit into\
  \ memory, sorts them and writes to a temporary directory, and then merges them.\
  \ After merging temporary files are removed automatically. The sort is stable, and\
  \ efforts have been done to make it multithreaded.\nBoth sorting orders are supported.\
  \ Default one is 'coordinate' because this is the one used for building index later.\
  \ In order to switch to 'qname' sorting order, use -n|--sort-by-name flag."
