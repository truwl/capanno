description: "Outputs some statistics drawn from read flags.\nFirst line contains\
  \ numbers of QC-passed and QC-failed reads. Then come pairs of numbers, the former\
  \ for QC-passed reads, the latter for QC-failed ones:\nduplicates mapped reads (plus\
  \ percentage relative to the numbers from the first line) reads with 'is_paired'\
  \ flag set paired reads which are first mates paired reads which are second mates\
  \ paired reads with 'proper_pair' flag set (plus percentage relative to the numbers\
  \ of QC-passed/failed reads with 'is_paired' flag set) paired reads where both mates\
  \ are mapped paired reads where read itself is unmapped but mate is mapped paired\
  \ reads where mate is mapped to a different chromosome the same as previous but\
  \ mapping quality is not less than 5"
