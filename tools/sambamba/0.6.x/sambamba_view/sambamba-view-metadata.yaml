description: "sambamba view allows to efficiently filter BAM file for alignments satisfying\
  \ various conditions, as well as access its SAM header and information about reference\
  \ sequences. In order to make these data readily available for consumption by scripts\
  \ in Perl/Python/Ruby, JSON output is provided.\nBy default, the tool expects BAM\
  \ file as an input. In order to work with SAM file, specify -S|--sam-input command-line\
  \ option, the tool does NOT try to guess file format from extension. Beware that\
  \ when reading SAM, the tool will skip tags which don't conform to the SAM/BAM specification,\
  \ and set invalid fields to their default values. However, only syntax is checked,\
  \ use --valid for full validation."
