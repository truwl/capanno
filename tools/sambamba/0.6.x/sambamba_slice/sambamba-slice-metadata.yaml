description: "Outputs reads overlapping specified region into new BAM file. (Default\
  \ destination is STDOUT.) Input file must be coordinate-sorted and indexed.\nWhile\
  \ the same can be done with sambamba-view, that would be much slower due to a lot\
  \ of compression/decompression work. Instead of naive method, sambamba-slice leverages\
  \ knowledge about structure of BAM file and recompresses only a few BGZF blocks\
  \ at the beginning and the end of the region, while the BGZF blocks in the middle\
  \ are copied as is. As such, this tool doesn't offer any options related to number\
  \ of threads or compression level - most of the time is spent on I/O operations."
