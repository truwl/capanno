description: "Find and remove adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types\
  \ of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.\nCleaning your\
  \ data in this way is often required: Reads from small-RNA sequencing contain the\
  \ 3’ sequencing adapter because the read is longer than the molecule that is sequenced.\
  \ Amplicon reads start with a primer sequence. Poly-A tails are useful for pulling\
  \ out RNA from your sample, but often you don’t want them to be in your reads.\n\
  Cutadapt helps with these trimming tasks by finding the adapter or primer sequences\
  \ in an error-tolerant way. It can also modify and filter single-end and paired-end\
  \ reads in various ways. Adapter sequences can contain IUPAC wildcard characters.\
  \ Cutadapt can also demultiplex your reads.\nCutadapt is available under the terms\
  \ of the MIT license.\nCutadapt development was started at TU Dortmund University\
  \ in the group of Prof. Dr. Sven Rahmann. It is currently being developed within\
  \ NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden)."
