description: Subread is a general-purpose read aligner which can be used to map both
  genomic DNA-seq reads and RNA-seq reads. It uses a new mapping paradigm called "seed-and-vote"
  to achieve fast, accurate and scalable read mapping. It automatically determines
  if a read should be globally or locally aligned, therefore particularly powerful
  in mapping RNA-seq reads. It supports indel detection and can map reads with both
  fixed and variable lengths.
