description: Shovill is a pipeline for assembly of bacterial isolate genomes from
  Illumina paired-end reads.  Shovill uses SPAdes at its core, but alters the steps
  before and after the primary assembly step to get similar results in less time.
  Shovill also supports other assemblers like SKESA, Velvet and Megahit, so you can
  take advantage of the pre- and post-processing the Shovill provides with those too.
