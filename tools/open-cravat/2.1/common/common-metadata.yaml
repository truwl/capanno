description: OpenCRAVAT is a new open source, scalable decision support system to
  support variant and gene prioritization. It offers a dynamic GUI, allowing users
  to easily, download tools from an extensive resource catalog, create customized
  pipelines, run jobs at speeds that exceed current variant annotation API services,
  and explore results in a richly detailed viewing environment. OpenCRAVAT is distinguished
  from similar tools by the amount and diversity of data resources and computational
  prediction methods available, which span germline, somatic, common, rare, coding
  and non-coding variants. We have designed the OpenCRAVAT resource catalog to be
  open and modular to maximize community and developer involvement, and as a result
  the catalog is being actively developed and growing larger every month.
