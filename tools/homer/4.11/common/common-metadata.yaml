description: HOMER contains a novel motif discovery algorithm that was designed for
  regulatory element analysis in genomics applications (DNA only, no protein).  It
  is a differential motif discovery algorithm, which means that it takes two sets
  of sequences and tries to identify the regulatory elements that are specifically
  enriched in on set relative to the other.  It uses ZOOPS scoring (zero or one occurrence
  per sequence) coupled with the hypergeometric enrichment calculations (or binomial)
  to determine motif enrichment.  HOMER also tries its best to account for sequenced
  bias in the dataset.  It was designed with ChIP-Seq and promoter analysis in mind,
  but can be applied to pretty much any nucleic acids motif finding problem.
