  Papermill is a tool for parameterizing and executing Jupyter Notebooks.

  Papermill lets you:

  - parameterize notebooks

  - execute notebooks

  This opens up new opportunities for how notebooks can be used. For example:

  - Perhaps you have a financial report that you wish to run with different values on the first or last day of a month or at the beginning or end of the year, using parameters makes this task easier.

  - Do you want to run a notebook and depending on its results, choose a particular notebook to run next? You can now programmatically execute a workflow without having to copy and paste from notebook to notebook manually.
