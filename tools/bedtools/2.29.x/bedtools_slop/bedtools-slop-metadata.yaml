description: bedtools slop will increase the size of each feature in a feature file
  by a user-defined number of bases. While something like this could be done with
  an awk '{OFS="\t" print $1,$2-<slop>,$3+<slop>}', bedtools slop will restrict the
  resizing to the size of the chromosome (i.e. no start < 0 and no end > chromosome
  size).
