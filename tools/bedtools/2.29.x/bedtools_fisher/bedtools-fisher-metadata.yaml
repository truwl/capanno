description: "Perform fisher’s exact test on the number of overlaps/unique intervals\
  \ between 2 files.\n\nTraditionally, in order to test whether 2 sets of intervals\
  \ are related spatially, we resort to shuffling the genome and checking the simulated\
  \ (shuffled) versus the observed. We can do the same analytically for many scenarios\
  \ using Fisher’s Exact Test.\nThis implementation can calculate the number of overlaps\
  \ and the number of intervals unique to each file and it infers (or accepts) the\
  \ number that are not present in each file."
