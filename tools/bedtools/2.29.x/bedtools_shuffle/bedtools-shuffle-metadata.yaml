description: bedtools shuffle will randomly permute the genomic locations of a feature
  file among a genome defined in a genome file. One can also provide an “exclusions”
  BED/GFF/VCF file that lists regions where you do not want the permuted features
  to be placed. For example, one might want to prevent features from being placed
  in known genome gaps. shuffle is useful as a null basis against which to test the
  significance of associations of one feature with another.
