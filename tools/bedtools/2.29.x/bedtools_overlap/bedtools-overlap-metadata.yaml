description: overlap computes the amount of overlap (in the case of positive values)
  or distance (in the case of negative values) between feature coordinates occurring
  on the same input line and reports the result at the end of the same line. In this
  way, it is a useful method for computing custom overlap scores from the output of
  other BEDTools.
