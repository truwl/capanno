description: pairToPair compares two BEDPE files in search of overlaps where each
  end of a BEDPE feature in A overlaps with the ends of a feature in B. For example,
  using pairToPair, one could screen for the exact same discordant paired-end alignment
  in two files. This could suggest (among other things) that the discordant pair suggests
  the same structural variation in each file/sample.
