description: By far, the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features
  is whether or not any of the features in the two sets “overlap” with one another.
  This is known as feature intersection. bedtools intersect allows one to screen for
  overlaps between two sets of genomic features. Moreover, it allows one to have fine
  control as to how the intersections are reported. bedtools intersect works with
  both BED/GFF/VCF and BAM files as input.
