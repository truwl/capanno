description: bedtools subtract bedtools` subtract searches for features in B that
  overlap A by at least the number of base pairs given by the -f option. If an overlapping
  feature is found in B, the overlapping portion is removed from A and the remaining
  portion of A is reported. If a feature in B overlaps all of a feature in A, the
  A feature will not be reported. If a feature in B does not overlap a feature in
  A by at least the -f amount, the A feature will be reported in its entirety.
