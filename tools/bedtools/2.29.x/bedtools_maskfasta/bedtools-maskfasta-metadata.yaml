description: bedtools maskfasta masks sequences in a FASTA file based on intervals
  defined in a feature file. The headers in the input FASTA file must exactly match
  the chromosome column in the feature file. This may be useful fro creating your
  own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target
  regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment.
