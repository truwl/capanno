description: "Tabix indexes a TAB-delimited genome position file in.tab.bgz and creates\
  \ an index file (in.tab.bgz.tbi or in.tab.bgz.csi) when region is absent from the\
  \ command-line. The input data file must be position sorted and compressed by bgzip\
  \ which has a gzip(1) like interface.\n\nAfter indexing, tabix is able to quickly\
  \ retrieve data lines overlapping regions specified in the format \"chr:beginPos-endPos\"\
  . (Coordinates specified in this region format are 1-based and inclusive.)\n\nFast\
  \ data retrieval also works over network if URI is given as a file name and in this\
  \ case the index file will be downloaded if it is not present locally.\n\nThe tabix\
  \ (.tbi) and BAI index formats can handle individual chromosomes up to 512 Mbp (2^29\
  \ bases) in length. If your input file might contain data lines with begin or end\
  \ positions greater than that, you will need to use a CSI index."
