description: "Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference\
  \ genome.\nIt is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and insertion/deletion\
  \ (INDEL)\npolymorphisms, and simulate reads with uniform substitution sequencing\
  \ errors.\nIt does not generate INDEL sequencing errors, but this can be partly\n\
  compensated by simulating INDEL polymorphisms.\n\nWgsim outputs the simulated polymorphisms,\
  \ and writes the true read coordinates\nas well as the number of polymorphisms and\
  \ sequencing errors in read names.\nOne can evaluate the accuracy of a mapper or\
  \ a SNP caller with wgsim_eval.pl\nthat comes with the package."
