description: Groups reads together that appear to have come from the same original molecule. Reads are grouped by template, and then templates are sorted by the 5â€™ mapping positions of the reads from the template, used from earliest mapping position to latest. Reads that have the same end positions are then sub-grouped by UMI sequence.
