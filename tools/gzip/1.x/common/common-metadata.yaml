description: "Gzip  reduces  the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).\
  \  Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension .gz, while\
  \ keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times.  (The default\
  \ extension is -gz for VMS, z for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If\
  \ no files are specified, or if a file name is \"-\", the standard input is compressed\
  \ to the standard output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In\
  \ particular, it will ignore symbolic links.\nIf the compressed file name is too\
  \ long for its file system, gzip truncates it.  Gzip attempts to truncate only the\
  \ parts of the file name longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.)\
  \ If the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For\
  \ example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed\
  \ to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which do not have a limit\
  \ on file name length.\nBy default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp\
  \ in the compressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the -N\
  \ option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or when the\
  \ time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.\nCompressed files can be restored\
  \ to their original form using gzip -d or gunzip or zcat.  If the original name\
  \ saved in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a new name is\
  \ constructed from the original one to make it legal.\ngunzip  takes  a  list of\
  \ files on its command line and replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz,\
  \ .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which begins with the correct magic number with\
  \ an uncompressed file without the original extension.  gunzip also recognizes the\
  \ special extensions .tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.\
  \  When compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of truncating\
  \ a file with a .tar extension.\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by\
  \ gzip, zip, compress, compress -H or pack.  The detection of the input format is\
  \ automatic.  When using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For\
  \ pack and gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format was\
  \  not designed  to allow consistency checks. However gunzip is sometimes able to\
  \ detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not\
  \ assume that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard uncompress does\
  \ not complain. This generally means that the standard uncom‚Äê press does not check\
  \ its input, and happily generates garbage output.  The SCO compress -H format (lzh\
  \ compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks.\n\
  Files created by zip can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a single member\
  \ compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is only intended to help\
  \ conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.  To extract a zip file with\
  \ a single member, use a command like  gunzip  <foo.zip or gunzip -S .zip foo.zip.\
  \  To extract zip files with several members, use unzip instead of gunzip.\nzcat\
  \  is  identical to gunzip -c.  (On some systems, zcat may be installed as gzcat\
  \ to preserve the original link to compress.)  zcat uncompresses either a list of\
  \ files on the command line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data\
  \ on standard output.  zcat will uncompress files that have the correct magic number\
  \ whether they have a .gz suffix or not.\nGzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used\
  \ in zip and PKZIP.  The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the\
  \ input and the distribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source\
  \ code or English is reduced by 60-70%.  Compression is  generally  much  better\
  \  than  that achieved by LZW (as used in compress), Huffman coding (as used in\
  \ pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).\nCompression  is always performed,\
  \ even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the original. The worst case\
  \ expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block,\
  \ or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number of\
  \ used disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode, ownership and\
  \ timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing."
