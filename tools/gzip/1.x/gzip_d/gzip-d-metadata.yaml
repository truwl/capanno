description: "gunzip  takes  a  list of files on its command line and replaces each\
  \ file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which begins\
  \ with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the original extension.\
  \ gunzip also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and .taz as shorthands for\
  \ .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively. When compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension\
  \ if necessary instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.\ngunzip can currently\
  \ decompress files created by gzip, zip, compress, compress -H or pack. The detection\
  \ of the input format is automatic. When using the first two formats, gunzip checks\
  \ a 32 bit CRC. For pack and gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard\
  \ compress format was  not designed  to allow consistency checks. However gunzip\
  \ is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing\
  \ a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard\
  \ uncompress does not complain. This generally means that the standard uncompress\
  \ does not check its input, and happily generates garbage output. The SCO compress\
  \ -H format (lzh compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some\
  \ consistency checks."
