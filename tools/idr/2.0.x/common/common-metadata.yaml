description: "The IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate) framework is a uniﬁed approach\
  \ to measure the reproducibility of ﬁndings identiﬁed from replicate experiments\
  \ and provide highly stable thresholds based on reproducibility. Unlike the usual\
  \ scalar measures of reproducibility, the IDR approach creates a curve, which quantitatively\
  \ assesses when the ﬁndings are no longer consistent across replicates. In layman's\
  \ terms, the IDR method compares a pair of ranked lists of identifications (such\
  \ as ChIP-seq peaks). These ranked lists should not be pre-thresholded i.e. they\
  \ should provide identifications across the entire spectrum of high confidence/enrichment\
  \ (signal) and low confidence/enrichment (noise). The IDR method then fits the bivariate\
  \ rank distributions over the replicates in order to separate signal from noise\
  \ based on a defined confidence of rank consistency and reproducibility of identifications\
  \ i.e the IDR threshold.\nThe method was developed by Qunhua Li and Peter Bickel's\
  \ group and is extensively used by the ENCODE and modENCODE projects and is part\
  \ of their ChIP-seq guidelines and standards."
