description: "RazerS 3 is a tool for mapping millions of short genomic reads onto\
  \ a\nreference genome. It was designed with focus on mapping next-generation\nsequencing\
  \ reads onto whole DNA genomes. RazerS 3 searches for matches of\nreads with a percent\
  \ identity above a given threshold (-i X), whereby it\ndetects alignments with mismatches\
  \ as well as gaps."
