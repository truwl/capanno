description: AdapterRemoval searches for and removes adapter sequences from High-Throughput
  Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality bases from the 3' end of
  reads following adapter removal. AdapterRemoval can analyze both single end and
  paired end data, and can be used to merge overlapping paired-ended reads into (longer)
  consensus sequences. Additionally, AdapterRemoval can construct a consensus adapter
  sequence for paired-ended reads, if which this information is not available.
