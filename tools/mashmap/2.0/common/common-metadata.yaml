description: |
  MashMap implements a fast and approximate algorithm for computing local alignment boundaries between long DNA sequences.
  It can be useful for mapping genome assembly or long reads (PacBio/ONT) to reference genome(s).
  Given a minimum alignment length and an identity threshold for the desired local alignments,
  Mashmap computes alignment boundaries and identity estimates using k-mers.
  It does not compute the alignments explicitly, but rather estimates a k-mer based Jaccard similarity using a combination of Minimizers and MinHash.
  This is then converted to an estimate of sequence identity using the Mash distance.
  An appropriate k-mer sampling rate is automatically determined using the given minimum local alignment length and identity thresholds.
  The efficiency of the algorithm improves as both of these thresholds are increased.
