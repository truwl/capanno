description: "samtools sort [-l level] [-m maxMem] [-o out.bam] [-O format] [-n] [-t\
  \ tag] [-T tmpprefix] [-@ threads] [in.sam|in.bam|in.cram]\nSort alignments by leftmost\
  \ coordinates, or by read name when -n is used. An appropriate @HD-SO sort order\
  \ header tag will be added or an existing one updated if necessary.\nThe sorted\
  \ output is written to standard output by default, or to the specified file (out.bam)\
  \ when -o is used. This command will also create temporary files tmpprefix.%d.bam\
  \ as needed when the entire alignment data cannot fit into memory (as controlled\
  \ via the -m option).\nConsider using samtools collate instead if you need name\
  \ collated data without a full lexicographical sort."
