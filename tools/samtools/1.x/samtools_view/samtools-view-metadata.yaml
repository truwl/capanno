  samtools view [options] in.sam|in.bam|in.cram [region...]

  With no options or regions specified, prints all alignments in the specified input
  alignment file (in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format) to standard output in SAM format (with
  no header by default).

  You may specify one or more space-separated region specifications after the input
  filename to restrict output to only those alignments which overlap the specified
  region(s).
  Use of region specifications requires a coordinate-sorted and indexed input file.

  Options exist to change the output format from SAM to BAM or CRAM, so this command
  also acts as a file format conversion utility.
