description: "samtools fqidx <ref.fastq> [region1 [...]]\nIndex reference sequence\
  \ in the FASTQ format or extract subsequence from indexed reference sequence. If\
  \ no region is specified, fqidx will index the file and create <ref.fastq>.fai on\
  \ the disk. If regions are specified, the subsequences will be retrieved and printed\
  \ to stdout in the FASTQ format.\nThe input file can be compressed in the BGZF format.\n\
  samtools fqidx should only be used on fastq files with a small number of entries.\
  \ Trying to use it on a file containing millions of short sequencing reads will\
  \ produce an index that is almost as big as the original file, and searches using\
  \ the index will be very slow and use a lot of memory."
