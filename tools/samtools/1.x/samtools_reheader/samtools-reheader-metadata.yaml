description: "samtools reheader [-iP] in.header.sam in.bam\nReplace the header in\
  \ in.bam with the header in in.header.sam. This command is much faster than replacing\
  \ the header with a BAM→SAM→BAM conversion.\nBy default this command outputs the\
  \ BAM or CRAM file to standard output (stdout), but for CRAM format files it has\
  \ the option to perform an in-place edit, both reading and writing to the same file.\
  \ No validity checking is performed on the header, nor that it is suitable to use\
  \ with the sequence data itself."
