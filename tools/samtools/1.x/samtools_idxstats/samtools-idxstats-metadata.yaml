description: "samtools idxstats in.sam|in.bam|in.cram\nRetrieve and print stats in\
  \ the index file corresponding to the input file. Before calling idxstats, the input\
  \ BAM file should be indexed by samtools index.\nIf run on a SAM or CRAM file or\
  \ an unindexed BAM file, this command will still produce the same summary statistics,\
  \ but does so by reading through the entire file. This is far slower than using\
  \ the BAM indices.\nThe output is TAB-delimited with each line consisting of reference\
  \ sequence name, sequence length, # mapped reads and # unmapped reads. It is written\
  \ to stdout."
