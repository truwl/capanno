description: "samtools depad [-SsCu1] [-T ref.fa] [-o output] in.bam\nConverts a BAM\
  \ aligned against a padded reference to a BAM aligned against the depadded reference.\
  \ The padded reference may contain verbatim \"*\" bases in it, but \"*\" bases are\
  \ also counted in the reference numbering. This means that a sequence base-call\
  \ aligned against a reference \"*\" is considered to be a cigar match (\"M\" or\
  \ \"X\") operator (if the base-call is \"A\", \"C\", \"G\" or \"T\"). After depadding\
  \ the reference \"*\" bases are deleted and such aligned sequence base-calls become\
  \ insertions. Similarly transformations apply for deletions and padding cigar operations."
