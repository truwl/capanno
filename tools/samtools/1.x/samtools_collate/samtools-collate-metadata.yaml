description: "samtools collate [options] in.sam|in.bam|in.cram [<prefix>]\nShuffles\
  \ and groups reads together by their names. A faster alternative to a full query\
  \ name sort, collate ensures that reads of the same name are grouped together in\
  \ contiguous groups, but doesn't make any guarantees about the order of read names\
  \ between groups.\nThe output from this command should be suitable for any operation\
  \ that requires all reads from the same template to be grouped together."
