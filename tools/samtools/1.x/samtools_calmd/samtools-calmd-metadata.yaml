description: "samtools calmd [-Eeubr] [-C capQcoef] aln.bam ref.fasta\nGenerate the\
  \ MD tag. If the MD tag is already present, this command will give a warning if\
  \ the MD tag generated is different from the existing tag. Output SAM by default.\n\
  Calmd can also read and write CRAM files although in most cases it is pointless\
  \ as CRAM recalculates MD and NM tags on the fly. The one exception to this case\
  \ is where both input and output CRAM files have been / are being created with the\
  \ no_ref option."
