description: Primerclip™ is an alignment-based primer trimming tool designed to trim
  primer sequences for Swift Biosciences Accel-Amplicon™ panels. The motivation for
  designing an alignment-based primer trimming tool to increase speed. Primerclip
  uses an algorithm based on genomic intervals of the aligned reads rather than the
  sequence matching approach necessarily used by most trimming tools to trim adapter
  sequences. Trimming based on alignment position allows primerclip to run in significantly
  less time than sequence-based trim tools, particularly as the size of the targeted
  panel increases.
