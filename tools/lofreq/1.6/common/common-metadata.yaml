description: LoFreq* (i.e. LoFreq version 2) is a fast and sensitive variant-caller
  for inferring SNVs and indels from next-generation sequencing data. It makes full
  use of base-call qualities and other sources of errors inherent in sequencing (e.g.
  mapping or base/indel alignment uncertainty), which are usually ignored by other
  methods or only used for filtering.
