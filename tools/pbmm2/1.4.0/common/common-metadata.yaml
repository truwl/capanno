description: pbmm2 is a SMRT C++ wrapper for minimap2's C API. Its purpose is to support
  native PacBio in- and output, provide sets of recommended parameters, generate sorted
  output on-the-fly, and postprocess alignments. Sorted output can be used directly
  for polishing using GenomicConsensus, if BAM has been used as input to pbmm2. Benchmarks
  show that pbmm2 outperforms BLASR in sequence identity, number of mapped bases,
  and especially runtime. pbmm2 is the official replacement for BLASR.
