description: STRling (pronounced like “sterling”) is a method to detect large STR
  expansions from short-read sequencing data. It is capable of detecting novel STR
  expansions, that is expansions where there is no STR in the reference genome at
  that position (or a different repeat unit from what is in the reference). It can
  also detect STR expansions that are annotated in the reference genome. STRling uses
  kmer counting to recover mis-mapped STR reads. It then uses soft-clipped reads to
  precisely discover the position of the STR expansion in the reference genome.
