description: Converts a BED file to a Picard Interval List. This tool provides easy conversion from BED to the Picard interval_list format which is required by many Picard processing tools. Note that the coordinate system of BED files is such that the first base or position in a sequence is numbered "0", while in interval_list files it is numbered "1".
