description: Generate index statistics from a BAM fileThis tool calculates statistics
  from a BAM index (.bai) file, emulating the behavior of the "samtools idxstats"
  command. The statistics collected include counts of aligned and unaligned reads
  as well as all records with no start coordinate. The input to the tool is the BAM
  file name but it must be accompanied by a corresponding index file.
