description: Finds mendelian violations of all types within a VCF. Takes in VCF or
  BCF and a pedigree file and looks for high confidence calls where the genotype of
  the offspring is incompatible with the genotypes of the parents. Assumes the existence
  of format fields AD, DP, GT, GQ, and PL fields. Take note that the implementation
  assumes that reads from the PAR will be mapped to the female chromosome rather than
  the male. This requires that the PAR in the male chromosome be masked so that the
  aligner has a single coting to map to. This is normally done for the public releases
  of the human reference.
