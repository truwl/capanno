description: 'Class to downsample a BAM file while respecting that we should either
  get rid of both ends of a pair or neither end of the pair. In addition, this program
  uses the read-name and extracts the position within the tile whence the read came
  from. The downsampling is based on this position. Results with the exact same input
  will produce the same results. Note 1: This is technology and read-name dependent.
  If your read-names do not have coordinate information, or if your BAM contains reads
  from multiple technologies (flowcell versions, sequencing machines) this will not
  work properly. This has been designed with Illumina MiSeq/HiSeq in mind. Note 2:
  The downsampling is not random. It is deterministically dependent on the position
  of the read within its tile. Note 3: Downsampling twice with this program is not
  supported. Note 4: You should call MarkDuplicates after downsampling. Finally, the
  code has been designed to simulate sequencing less as accurately as possible, not
  for getting an exact downsample fraction. In particular, since the reads may be
  distributed non-evenly within the lanes/tiles, the resulting downsampling percentage
  will not be accurately determined by the input argument FRACTION.'
