description: "Identifies duplicate reads using information from read positions and\
  \ UMIs.\nThis tool locates and tags duplicate reads in a BAM or SAM file, where\
  \ duplicate reads are defined as originating from a single fragment of DNA. It is\
  \ based on the MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar tool, with added logic to leverage Unique\
  \ Molecular Identifier (UMI) information.\nIn addition to assuming that all members\
  \ of a duplicate set must have the same start and end position, it imposes that\
  \ they must also have sufficiently similar UMIs. In this context, 'sufficiently\
  \ similar' is parameterized by the command line argument MAX_EDIT_DISTANCE_TO_JOIN,\
  \ which sets the edit distance between UMIs that will be considered to be part of\
  \ the same original molecule. This logic allows for sequencing errors in UMIs.\n\
  This tool is NOT intended to be used on data without UMIs; for marking duplicates\
  \ in non-UMI data, see MarkDuplicates or MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar. Mixed data\
  \ (where some reads have UMIs and others do not) is not supported."
