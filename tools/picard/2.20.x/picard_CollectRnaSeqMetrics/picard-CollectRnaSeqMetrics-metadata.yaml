description: "Produces RNA alignment metrics for a SAM or BAM file.\nThis tool takes\
  \ a SAM/BAM file containing the aligned reads from an RNAseq experiment and produces\
  \ metrics describing the distribution of the bases within the transcripts. It calculates\
  \ the total numbers and the fractions of nucleotides within specific genomic regions\
  \ including untranslated regions (UTRs), introns, intergenic sequences (between\
  \ discrete genes), and peptide-coding sequences (exons). This tool also determines\
  \ the numbers of bases that pass quality filters that are specific to Illumina data\
  \ (PF_BASES). For more information please see the corresponding GATK Dictionary\
  \ entry.\nOther metrics include the median coverage (depth), the ratios of 5 prime\
  \ /3 prime-biases, and the numbers of reads with the correct/incorrect strand designation.\
  \ The 5 prime /3 prime-bias results from errors introduced by reverse transcriptase\
  \ enzymes during library construction, ultimately leading to the over-representation\
  \ of either the 5 prime or 3 prime ends of transcripts. Please see the CollectRnaSeqMetrics\
  \ definitions for details on how these biases are calculated.\nThe sequence input\
  \ must be a valid SAM/BAM file containing RNAseq data aligned by an RNAseq-aware\
  \ genome aligner such a STAR or TopHat. The tool also requires a REF_FLAT file,\
  \ a tab-delimited file containing information about the location of RNA transcripts,\
  \ exon start and stop sites, etc. For an example refFlat file for GRCh38, see refFlat.txt.gz\
  \ at http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database. The first five lines\
  \ of the tab-limited text file appear as follows.\nDDX11L1\tNR_046018\tchr1\t+\t\
