description: "Collect multiple classes of metrics. This 'meta-metrics' tool runs one\
  \ or more of the metrics collection modules at the same time to cut down on the\
  \ time spent reading in data from input files. Available modules include CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics,\
  \ CollectInsertSizeMetrics, QualityScoreDistribution, MeanQualityByCycle, CollectBaseDistributionByCycle,\
  \ CollectGcBiasMetrics, RnaSeqMetrics, CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics, and CollectQualityYieldMetrics.\
  \ The tool produces outputs of '.pdf' and '.txt' files for each module, except for\
  \ the CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics module, which outputs only a '.txt' file. Output\
  \ files are named by specifying a base name (without any file extensions).\nCurrently\
  \ all programs are run with default options and fixed output extensions, but this\
  \ may become more flexible in future. Specifying a reference sequence file is required.\n\
  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
