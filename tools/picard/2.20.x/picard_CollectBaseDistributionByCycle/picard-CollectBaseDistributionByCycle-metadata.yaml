description: "Chart the nucleotide distribution per cycle in a SAM or BAM fileThis\
  \ tool produces a chart of the nucleotide distribution per cycle in a SAM or BAM\
  \ file in order to enable assessment of systematic errors at specific positions\
  \ in the reads.\nInterpretation notes: Increased numbers of miscalled bases will\
  \ be reflected in base distribution changes and increases in the number of Ns. In\
  \ general, we expect that for any given cycle, or position within reads, the relative\
  \ proportions of A, T, C and G should reflect the AT:GC content of the organism's\
  \ genome. Thus, for all four nucleotides, flattish lines would be expected. Deviations\
  \ from this expectation, for example a spike of A at a particular cycle (position\
  \ within reads), would suggest a systematic sequencing error.\nNote on quality trimming:\
  \ In the past, many sequencing data processing workflows included discarding the\
  \ low-quality tails of reads by applying hard-clipping at some arbitrary base quality\
  \ threshold value. This is no longer useful because most sophisticated analysis\
  \ tools (such as the GATK variant discovery tools) are quality-aware, meaning that\
  \ they are able to take base quality into account when weighing evidence provided\
  \ by sequencing reads. Unnecessary clipping may interfere with other quality control\
  \ evaluations and may lower the quality of analysis results. For example, trimming\
  \ reduces the effectiveness of the Base Recalibration (BQSR) pre-processing step\
  \ of the GATK Best Practices for Variant Discovery, which aims to correct some types\
  \ of systematic biases that affect the accuracy of base quality scores.\nNote: Metrics\
  \ labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
