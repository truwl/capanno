description: "Tool determines the barcode for each read in an Illumina lane.\nThis\
  \ tool determines the numbers of reads containing barcode-matching sequences and\
  \ provides statistics on the quality of these barcode matches.\nIllumina sequences\
  \ can contain at least two types of barcodes, sample and molecular (index). Sample\
  \ barcodes (B in the read structure) are used to demultiplex pooled samples while\
  \ index barcodes (M in the read structure) are used to differentiate multiple reads\
  \ of a template when carrying out paired-end sequencing. Note that this tool only\
  \ extracts sample (B) and not molecular barcodes (M).\nBarcodes can be provided\
  \ in the form of a list (BARCODE_FILE) or a string representing the barcode (BARCODE).\
  \ The BARCODE_FILE contains multiple fields including 'barcode_sequence_1', 'barcode_sequence_2'\
  \ (optional), 'barcode_name', and 'library_name'. In contrast, the BARCODE argument\
  \ is used for runs with reads containing a single barcode (nonmultiplexed) and can\
  \ be added directly as a string of text e.g. BARCODE=CAATAGCG.\nData is output per\
  \ lane/tile within the BaseCalls directory with the file name format of 's_{lane}_{tile}_barcode.txt'.\
  \ These files contain the following tab-separated columns:\nRead subsequence at\
  \ barcode position Y or N indicating if there was a barcode match Matched barcode\
  \ sequence (empty if read did not match one of the barcodes) The number of mismatches\
  \ if there was a barcode match The number of mismatches to the second best barcode\
  \ if there was a barcode match If there is no match but we're close to the threshold\
  \ of calling it a match, we output the barcode that would have been matched but\
  \ in lower case. Threshold values can be adjusted to accommodate barcode sequence\
  \ mismatches from the reads. The metrics file produced by the ExtractIlluminaBarcodes\
  \ program indicates the number of matches (and mismatches) between the barcode reads\
  \ and the actual barcodes. These metrics are provided both per-barcode and per lane\
  \ and can be found in the BaseCalls directory. For poorly matching barcodes, the\
  \ order of specification of barcodes can cause arbitrary output differences."
