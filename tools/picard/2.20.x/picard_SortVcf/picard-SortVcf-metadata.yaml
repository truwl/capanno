description: "Sorts one or more VCF files. This tool sorts the records in VCF files\
  \ according to the order of the contigs in the header/sequence dictionary and then\
  \ by coordinate. It can accept an external sequence dictionary. If no external dictionary\
  \ is supplied, the VCF file headers of multiple inputs must have the same sequence\
  \ dictionaries.\nIf running on multiple inputs (originating from e.g. some scatter-gather\
  \ runs), the input files must contain the same sample names in the same column order."
