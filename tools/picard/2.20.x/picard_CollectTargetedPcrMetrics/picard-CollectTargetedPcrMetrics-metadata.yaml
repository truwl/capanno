description: "Calculate PCR-related metrics from targeted sequencing data.\nThis tool\
  \ calculates a set of PCR-related metrics from an aligned SAM or BAM file containing\
  \ targeted sequencing data. It is appropriate for data produced with multiple small-target\
  \ technologies including exome sequencing an custom amplicon panels such as the\
  \ Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) kit.\nIf a reference sequence is provided,\
  \ AT/GC dropout metrics will be calculated and the PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option can\
  \ be used to output GC content and mean coverage information for each target. The\
  \ AT/GC dropout metrics indicate the degree of inadequate coverage of a particular\
  \ region based on its AT or GC content. The PER_TARGET_COVERAGE option can be used\
  \ to output GC content and mean sequence depth information for every target interval.\n\
  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
