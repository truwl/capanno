description: "Collects Illumina Basecalling metrics for a sequencing run.\nThis tool\
  \ will produce per-barcode and per-lane basecall metrics for each sequencing run.\
  \ Mean values for each metric are determined using data from all of the tiles. This\
  \ tool requires the following data, LANE(#), BASECALLS_DIR, READ_STRUCTURE, and\
  \ an input file listing the sample barcodes. Program will provide metrics including:\
  \ the total numbers of bases, reads, and clusters, as well as the fractions of each\
  \ bases, reads, and clusters that passed Illumina quality filters (PF) both per\
  \ barcode and per lane. For additional information on Illumina's PF quality metric,\
  \ please see the corresponding GATK Dictionary entry.\nThe input barcode_list.txt\
  \ file is a file containing all of the sample and molecular barcodes and can be\
  \ obtained from the ExtractIlluminaBarcodes tool.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages\
  \ are actually expressed as fractions!"
