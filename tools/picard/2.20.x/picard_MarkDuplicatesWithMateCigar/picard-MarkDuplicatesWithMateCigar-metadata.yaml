description: "Identifies duplicate reads, accounting for mate CIGAR. This tool locates\
  \ and tags duplicate reads (both PCR and optical) in a BAM or SAM file, where duplicate\
  \ reads are defined as originating from the same original fragment of DNA, taking\
  \ into account the CIGAR string of read mates.\nIt is intended as an improvement\
  \ upon the original MarkDuplicates algorithm, from which it differs in several ways,\
  \ includingdifferences in how it breaks ties. It may be the most effective duplicate\
  \ marking program available, as it handles all cases including clipped and gapped\
  \ alignments and locates duplicate molecules using mate cigar information. However,\
  \ please note that it is not yet used in the Broad's production pipeline, so use\
  \ it at your own risk.\nNote also that this tool will not work with alignments that\
  \ have large gaps or deletions, such as those from RNA-seq data. This is due to\
  \ the need to buffer small genomic windows to ensure integrity of the duplicate\
  \ marking, while large skips (ex. skipping introns) in the alignment records would\
  \ force making that window very large, thus exhausting memory.\nNote: Metrics labeled\
  \ as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
