description: "Validates a SAM or BAM file.\nThis tool reports on the validity of a\
  \ SAM or BAM file relative to the SAM format specification. This is useful for troubleshooting\
  \ errors encountered with other tools that may be caused by improper formatting,\
  \ faulty alignments, incorrect flag values, etc.\nBy default, the tool runs in VERBOSE\
  \ mode and will exit after finding 100 errors and output them to the console (stdout).\
  \ Therefore, it is often more practical to run this tool initially using the MODE=SUMMARY\
  \ option. This mode outputs a summary table listing the numbers of all 'errors'\
  \ and 'warnings'.\nWhen fixing errors in your file, it is often useful to prioritize\
  \ the severe validation errors and ignore the errors/warnings of lesser concern.\
  \ This can be done using the IGNORE and/or IGNORE_WARNINGS arguments. For helpful\
  \ suggestions on error prioritization, please follow this link to obtain additional\
  \ documentation on ValidateSamFile.\nAfter identifying and fixing your 'warnings/errors',\
  \ we recommend that you rerun this tool to validate your SAM/BAM file prior to proceeding\
  \ with your downstream analysis. This will verify that all problems in your file\
  \ have been addressed."
