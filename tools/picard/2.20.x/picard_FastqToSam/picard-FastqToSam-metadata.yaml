description: "Converts a FASTQ file to an unaligned BAM or SAM file. This tool extracts\
  \ read sequences and base qualities from the input FASTQ file and writes them out\
  \ to a new file in unaligned BAM (uBAM) format. Read group information can be provided\
  \ on the command line.\nThree versions of FASTQ quality scales are supported: FastqSanger,\
  \ FastqSolexa and FastqIllumina (see http://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml for\
  \ details). Input FASTQ files can be in GZip format (with .gz extension)."
