description: Renames a sample within a VCF or BCF. This tool enables the user to rename
  a sample in either a VCF or BCF file. It is intended to change the name of a sample
  in a VCF prior to merging with VCF files in which one or more samples have similar
  names. Note that the input VCF file must be single-sample VCF and that the NEW_SAMPLE_NAME
  is required.
