description: "Transforms raw Illumina sequencing data into an unmapped SAM or BAM\
  \ file.\nThe IlluminaBaseCallsToSam program collects, demultiplexes, and sorts reads\
  \ across all of the tiles of a lane via barcode to produce an unmapped SAM/BAM file.\
  \ An unmapped BAM file is often referred to as a uBAM. All barcode, sample, and\
  \ library data is provided in the LIBRARY_PARAMS file. Note, this LIBRARY_PARAMS\
  \ file should be formatted according to the specifications indicated below. The\
  \ following is an example of a properly formatted LIBRARY_PARAMS file:\nBARCODE_1\
  \ OUTPUT SAMPLE_ALIAS LIBRARY_NAME AAAAAAAA SA_AAAAAAAA.bam SA_AAAAAAAA LN_AAAAAAAA\
  \ AAAAGAAG SA_AAAAGAAG.bam SA_AAAAGAAG LN_AAAAGAAG AACAATGG SA_AACAATGG.bam SA_AACAATGG\
  \ LN_AACAATGG N SA_non_indexed.bam SA_non_indexed LN_NNNNNNNN\nThe BARCODES_DIR\
  \ file is produced by the ExtractIlluminaBarcodes tool for each lane of a flow cell."
