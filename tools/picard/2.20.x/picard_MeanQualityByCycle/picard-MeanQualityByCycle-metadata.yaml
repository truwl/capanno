description: "Collect mean quality by cycle. This tool generates a data table and\
  \ chart of mean quality by cycle from a BAM file. It is intended to be used on a\
  \ single lane or a read group's worth of data, but can be applied to merged BAMs\
  \ if needed.\nThis metric gives an overall snapshot of sequencing machine performance.\
  \ For most types of sequencing data, the output is expected to show a slight reduction\
  \ in overall base quality scores towards the end of each read. Spikes in quality\
  \ within reads are not expected and may indicate that technical problems occurred\
  \ during sequencing.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed\
  \ as fractions!"
