description: "Produces a summary of alignment metrics from a SAM or BAM file. This\
  \ tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and produces metrics detailing the quality of\
  \ the read alignments as well as the proportion of the reads that passed machine\
  \ signal-to-noise threshold quality filters. Note that these quality filters are\
  \ specific to Illumina data; for additional information, please see the corresponding\
  \ GATK Dictionary entry.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed\
  \ as fractions!"
