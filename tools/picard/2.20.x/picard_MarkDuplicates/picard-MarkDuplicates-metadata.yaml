description: "Identifies duplicate reads.\nThis tool locates and tags duplicate reads\
  \ in a BAM or SAM file, where duplicate reads are defined as originating from a\
  \ single fragment of DNA. Duplicates can arise during sample preparation e.g. library\
  \ construction using PCR. See also EstimateLibraryComplexity for additional notes\
  \ on PCR duplication artifacts. Duplicate reads can also result from a single amplification\
  \ cluster, incorrectly detected as multiple clusters by the optical sensor of the\
  \ sequencing instrument. These duplication artifacts are referred to as optical\
  \ duplicates.\nThe MarkDuplicates tool works by comparing sequences in the 5 prime\
  \ positions of both reads and read-pairs in a SAM/BAM file. An BARCODE_TAG option\
  \ is available to facilitate duplicate marking using molecular barcodes. After duplicate\
  \ reads are collected, the tool differentiates the primary and duplicate reads using\
  \ an algorithm that ranks reads by the sums of their base-quality scores (default\
  \ method).\nThe tool's main output is a new SAM or BAM file, in which duplicates\
  \ have been identified in the SAM flags field for each read. Duplicates are marked\
  \ with the hexadecimal value of 0x0400, which corresponds to a decimal value of\
  \ 1024. If you are not familiar with this type of annotation, please see the following\
  \ blog post for additional information.\nAlthough the bitwise flag annotation indicates\
  \ whether a read was marked as a duplicate, it does not identify the type of duplicate.\
  \ To do this, a new tag called the duplicate type (DT) tag was recently added as\
  \ an optional output in the 'optional field' section of a SAM/BAM file. Invoking\
  \ the TAGGING_POLICY option, you can instruct the program to mark all the duplicates\
  \ (All), only the optical duplicates (OpticalOnly), or no duplicates (DontTag).\
  \ The records within the output of a SAM/BAM file will have values for the 'DT'\
  \ tag (depending on the invoked TAGGING_POLICY), as either library/PCR-generated\
  \ duplicates (LB), or sequencing-platform artifact duplicates (SQ). This tool uses\
  \ the READ_NAME_REGEX and the OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE options as the primary\
  \ methods to identify and differentiate duplicate types. Set READ_NAME_REGEX to\
  \ null to skip optical duplicate detection, e.g. for RNA-seq or other data where\
  \ duplicate sets are extremely large and estimating library complexity is not an\
  \ aim. Note that without optical duplicate counts, library size estimation will\
  \ be inaccurate.\nMarkDuplicates also produces a metrics file indicating the numbers\
  \ of duplicates for both single- and paired-end reads.\nThe program can take either\
  \ coordinate-sorted or query-sorted inputs, however the behavior is slightly different.\
  \ When the input is coordinate-sorted, unmapped mates of mapped records and supplementary/secondary\
  \ alignments are not marked as duplicates. However, when the input is query-sorted\
  \ (actually query-grouped), then unmapped mates and secondary/supplementary reads\
  \ are not excluded from the duplication test and can be marked as duplicate reads.\n\
  If desired, duplicates can be removed using the REMOVE_DUPLICATE and REMOVE_SEQUENCING_DUPLICATES\
  \ options."
