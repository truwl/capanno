description: Collects Illumina lane metrics for the given BaseCalling analysis directory.
  This tool produces quality control metrics on cluster density for each lane of an
  Illumina flowcell. This tool takes Illumina TileMetrics data and places them into
  directories containing lane- and phasing-level metrics. In this context, phasing
  refers to the fraction of molecules that fall behind or jump ahead (prephasing)
  during a read cycle.
