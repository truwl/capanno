description: Converts VCF to BCF or BCF to VCF. This tool converts files between the
  plain-text VCF format and its binary compressed equivalent, BCF. Input and output
  formats are determined by file extensions specified in the file names. For best
  results, it is recommended to ensure that an index file is present and set the REQUIRE_INDEX
  option to true.
