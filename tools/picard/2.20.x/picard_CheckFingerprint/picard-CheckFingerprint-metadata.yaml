description: "Computes a fingerprint from the supplied input file (SAM/BAM or VCF)\
  \ file and compares it to the expected fingerprint genotypes provided. The key output\
  \ is a LOD score which represents the relative likelihood of the sequence data originating\
  \ from the same sample as the genotypes vs. from a random sample. Two outputs are\
  \ produced: (1) a summary metrics file that gives metrics at the single sample level\
  \ (if the input was a VCF) or at the read level (lane or index within a lane) (if\
  \ the input was a SAM/BAM) versus a set of known genotypes for the expected sample,\
  \ and (2) a detail metrics file that contains an individual SNP/Haplotype comparison\
  \ within a fingerprint comparison. The two files may be specified individually using\
  \ the SUMMARY_OUTPUT and DETAIL_OUTPUT options. Alternatively the OUTPUT option\
  \ may be used instead to give the base of the two output files, with the summary\
  \ metrics having a file extension 'fingerprinting_summary_metrics' and the detail\
  \ metrics having a file extension 'fingerprinting_detail_metrics'."
