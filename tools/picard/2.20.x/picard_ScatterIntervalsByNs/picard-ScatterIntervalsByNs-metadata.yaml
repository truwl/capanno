description: Writes an interval list based on splitting a reference by Ns. This tool
  identifies positions in a reference where the bases are 'no-calls' and writes out
  an interval-list using the resulting coordinates. This can be used to create an
  interval list for whole genome sequence (WGS) for e.g. scatter-gather purposes,
  as an alternative to using fixed-length intervals. The number of contiguous nocalls
  that can be tolerated before creating a break is adjustable from the command line.
