description: "Generate FASTQ file(s) from Illumina basecall read data.\nThis tool\
  \ generates FASTQ files from data in an Illumina BaseCalls output directory. Separate\
  \ FASTQ files are created for each template, barcode, and index (molecular barcode)\
  \ read. Briefly, the template reads are the target sequence of your experiment,\
  \ the barcode sequence reads facilitate sample demultiplexing, and the index reads\
  \ help mitigate instrument phasing errors. For additional information on the read\
  \ types, please see the following reference here.\nIn the absence of sample pooling\
  \ (multiplexing) and/or barcodes, then an OUTPUT_PREFIX (file directory) must be\
  \ provided as the sample identifier. For multiplexed samples, a MULTIPLEX_PARAMS\
  \ file must be specified. The MULTIPLEX_PARAMS file contains the list of sample\
  \ barcodes used to sort template, barcode, and index reads. It is essentially the\
  \ same as the BARCODE_FILE used in theExtractIlluminaBarcodes tool.\nFiles from\
  \ this tool use the following naming format: {prefix}.{type}_{number}.fastq with\
  \ the {prefix} indicating the sample barcode, the {type} indicating the types of\
  \ reads e.g. index, barcode, or blank (if it contains a template read). The {number}\
  \ indicates the read number, either first (1) or second (2) for paired-end sequencing."
