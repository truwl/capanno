description: "Collect metrics regarding GC bias. This tool collects information about\
  \ the relative proportions of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides in a sample.\
  \ Regions of high and low G + C content have been shown to interfere with mapping/aligning,\
  \ ultimately leading to fragmented genome assemblies and poor coverage in a phenomenon\
  \ known as 'GC bias'. Detailed information on the effects of GC bias on the collection\
  \ and analysis of sequencing data can be found at DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0062856/.\n\
  The GC bias statistics are always output in a detailed long-form version, but a\
  \ summary can also be produced. Both the detailed metrics and the summary metrics\
  \ are output as tables '.txt' files) and an accompanying chart that plots the data\
  \ ('.pdf' file).\nDetailed metrics\nThe table of detailed metrics includes GC percentages\
  \ for each bin (GC), the percentage of WINDOWS corresponding to each GC bin of the\
  \ reference sequence, the numbers of reads that start within a particular %GC content\
  \ bin (READ_STARTS), and the mean base quality of the reads that correspond to a\
  \ specific GC content distribution window (MEAN_BASE_QUALITY). NORMALIZED_COVERAGE\
  \ is a relative measure of sequence coverage by the reads at a particular GC content.\
  \ For each run, the corresponding reference sequence is divided into bins or windows\
  \ based on the percentage of G + C content ranging from 0 - 100%. The percentages\
  \ of G + C are determined from a defined length of sequence; the default value is\
  \ set at 100 bases. The mean of the distribution will vary among organisms; human\
  \ DNA has a mean GC content of 40%, suggesting a slight preponderance of AT-rich\
  \ regions.\nSummary metrics\nThe table of summary metrics captures run-specific\
  \ bias information including WINDOW_SIZE, ALIGNED_READS, TOTAL_CLUSTERS, AT_DROPOUT,\
  \ and GC_DROPOUT. While WINDOW_SIZE refers to the numbers of bases used for the\
  \ distribution (see above), the ALIGNED_READS and TOTAL_CLUSTERS are the total number\
  \ of aligned reads and the total number of reads (after filtering) produced in a\
  \ run. In addition, the tool produces both AT_DROPOUT and GC_DROPOUT metrics, which\
  \ indicate the percentage of misaligned reads that correlate with low (%-GC is <\
  \ 50%) or high (%-GC is > 50%) GC content respectively.\nThe percentage of 'coverage'\
  \ or depth in a GC bin is calculated by dividing the number of reads of a particular\
  \ GC content by the mean number of reads of all GC bins. A number of 1 represents\
  \ mean coverage, a number less than 1 represents lower than mean coverage (e.g.\
  \ 0.5 means half as much coverage as average) while a number greater than 1 represents\
  \ higher than mean coverage (e.g. 3.1 means this GC bin has 3.1 times more reads\
  \ per window than average). This tool also tracks mean base-quality scores of the\
  \ reads within each GC content bin, enabling the user to determine how base quality\
  \ scores vary with GC content.\nThe chart output associated with this data table\
  \ plots the NORMALIZED_COVERAGE, the distribution of WINDOWs corresponding to GC\
  \ percentages, and base qualities corresponding to each %GC bin. Note: Metrics labeled\
  \ as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
