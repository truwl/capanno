description: "Classify PF-Failing reads in a HiSeqX Illumina Basecalling directory\
  \ into various categories.\nThis tool categorizes the reads that did not pass filter\
  \ (PF-Failing) into four groups. These groups are based on a heuristic that was\
  \ derived by looking at a few titration experiments. After examining the called\
  \ bases from the first 24 cycles of each read, the PF-Failed reads are grouped into\
  \ the following four categories:\n* MISALIGNED - The first 24 basecalls of a read\
  \ are uncalled (numNs~24). These types of reads appear to be flow cell artifacts\
  \ because reads were only found near tile boundaries and were concentration (library)\
  \ independent * EMPTY - All 24 bases are called (numNs~0) but the number of bases\
  \ with quality scores greater than two is less than or equal to eight (numQGtTwo<=8).\
  \ These reads were location independent within the tiles and were inversely proportional\
  \ to the library concentration * POLYCLONAL - All 24 bases were called and numQGtTwo>=12,\
  \ were independent of their location with the tiles, and were directly proportional\
  \ to the library concentration. These reads are likely the result of PCR artifacts\
  \ * UNKNOWN - The remaining reads that are PF-Failing but did not fit into any of\
  \ the groups listed above\nThe tool defaults to the SUMMARY output which indicates\
  \ the number of PF-Failed reads per tile and groups them into the categories described\
  \ above accordingly.\nA DETAILED metrics option is also available that subdivides\
  \ the SUMMARY outputs by the x- y- position of these reads within each tile. To\
  \ obtain the DETAILED metric table, you must add the PROB_EXPLICIT_READS option\
  \ to your command line and set the value between 0 and 1. This value represents\
  \ the fractional probability of PF-Failed reads to send to output. For example,\
  \ if PROB_EXPLICIT_READS=0, then no metrics will be output. If PROB_EXPLICIT_READS=1,\
  \ then it will provide detailed metrics for all (100%) of the reads. It follows\
  \ that setting the PROB_EXPLICIT_READS=0.5, will provide detailed metrics for half\
  \ of the PF-Failed reads.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed\
  \ as fractions!\n"
