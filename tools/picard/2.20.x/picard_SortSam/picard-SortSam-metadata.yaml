description: "Sorts a SAM or BAM file. This tool sorts the input SAM or BAM file by\
  \ coordinate, queryname (QNAME), or some other property of the SAM record. The SortOrder\
  \ of a SAM/BAM file is found in the SAM file header tag @HD in the field labeled\
  \ SO.\nFor a coordinate sorted SAM/BAM file, read alignments are sorted first by\
  \ the reference sequence name (RNAME) field using the reference sequence dictionary\
  \ (@SQ tag). Alignments within these subgroups are secondarily sorted using the\
  \ left-most mapping position of the read (POS). Subsequent to this sorting scheme,\
  \ alignments are listed arbitrarily.\nFor queryname-sorted alignments, all alignments\
  \ are grouped using the queryname field but the alignments are not necessarily sorted\
  \ within these groups. Reads having the same queryname are derived from the same\
  \ template."
