description: "Extract OxoG metrics from generalized artifacts metrics.\nThis tool\
  \ extracts 8-oxoguanine (OxoG) artifact metrics from the output of CollectSequencingArtifactsMetrics\
  \ (a tool that provides detailed information on a variety of artifacts found in\
  \ sequencing libraries) and converts them to the CollectOxoGMetrics tool's output\
  \ format. This conveniently eliminates the need to run CollectOxoGMetrics if we\
  \ already ran CollectSequencingArtifactsMetrics in our pipeline. See the documentation\
  \ for CollectSequencingArtifactsMetrics and CollectOxoGMetrics for additional information\
  \ on these tools.\nNote that only the base of the CollectSequencingArtifactsMetrics\
  \ output file name is required for the (INPUT_BASE) parameter. For example, if the\
  \ file name is artifact_metrics.txt.bait_bias_detail_metrics or artifact_metrics.txt.pre_adapter_detail_metrics,\
  \ only the file name base 'artifact_metrics' is required on the command line for\
  \ this parameter. An output file called 'artifact_metrics.oxog_metrics' will be\
  \ generated automatically. Finally, to run this tool successfully, the REFERENCE_SEQUENCE\
  \ must be provided."
