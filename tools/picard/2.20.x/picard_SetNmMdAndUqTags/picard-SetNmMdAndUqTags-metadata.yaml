description: Fixes the NM, MD, and UQ tags in a SAM file. This tool takes in a SAM
  or BAM file (sorted by coordinate) and calculates the NM, MD, and UQ tags by comparing
  with the reference. This may be needed when MergeBamAlignment was run with SORT_ORDER
  different from 'coordinate' and thus could not fix these tags then.
