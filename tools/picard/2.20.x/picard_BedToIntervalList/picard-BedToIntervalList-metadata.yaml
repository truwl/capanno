description: "Converts a BED file to a Picard Interval List. This tool provides easy\
  \ conversion from BED to the Picard interval_list format which is required by many\
  \ Picard processing tools. Note that the coordinate system of BED files is such\
  \ that the first base or position in a sequence is numbered \"0\", while in interval_list\
  \ files it is numbered \"1\".\nBED files contain sequence data displayed in a flexible\
  \ format that includes nine optional fields, in addition to three required fields\
  \ within the annotation tracks. The required fields of a BED file include:\n- chrom\
  \ - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr20) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671) - chromStart\
  \ - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first\
  \ base in a chromosome is numbered \"0\" - chromEnd - The ending position of the\
  \ feature in the chromosome or scaffold.  The chromEnd base is not included in the\
  \ display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined\
  \ as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.\nIn each annotation\
  \ track, the number of fields per line must be consistent throughout a data set.\
  \ For additional information regarding BED files and the annotation field options,\
  \ please see: http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1.\nInterval_list\
  \ files contain sequence data distributed into intervals. The interval_list file\
  \ format is relatively simple and reflects the SAM alignment format to a degree.\
  \ A SAM style header must be present in the file that lists the sequence records\
  \ against which the intervals are described. After the header, the file then contains\
  \ records, one per line in plain text format with the following values tab-separated::\n\
  -Sequence name (SN) - The name of the sequence in the file for identification purposes,\
  \ can be chromosome number e.g. chr20 -Start position - Interval start position\
  \ (starts at +1) -End position - Interval end position (1-based, end inclusive)\
  \ -Strand - Indicates +/- strand for the interval (either + or -) -Interval name\
  \ - (Each interval should have a unique name)\nThis tool requires a sequence dictionary,\
  \ provided with the SEQUENCE_DICTIONARY or SD argument. The value given to this\
  \ argument can be any of the following:\n- A file with .dict extension generated\
  \ using Picard's CreateSequenceDictionaryTool - A reference.fa or reference.fasta\
  \ file with a reference.dict in the same directory - Another IntervalList with @SQ\
  \ lines in the header from which to generate a dictionary - A VCF that contains\
  \ #contig lines from which to generate a sequence dictionary - A SAM or BAM file\
  \ with @SQ lines in the header from which to generate a dictionary"
