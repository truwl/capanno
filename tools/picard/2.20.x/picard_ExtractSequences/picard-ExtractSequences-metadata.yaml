description: Subsets intervals from a reference sequence to a new FASTA file. This
  tool takes a list of intervals, reads the corresponding subsquences from a reference
  FASTA file and writes them to a new FASTA file as separate records. Note that the
  reference FASTA file must be accompanied by an index file and the interval list
  must be provided in Picard list format. The names provided for the intervals will
  be used to name the corresponding records in the output file.
