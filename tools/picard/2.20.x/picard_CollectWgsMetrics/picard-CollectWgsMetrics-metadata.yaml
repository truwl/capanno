description: "Collect metrics about coverage and performance of whole genome sequencing\
  \ (WGS) experiments.\nThis tool collects metrics about the fractions of reads that\
  \ pass base- and mapping-quality filters as well as coverage (read-depth) levels\
  \ for WGS analyses. Both minimum base- and mapping-quality values as well as the\
  \ maximum read depths (coverage cap) are user defined.\nNote: Metrics labeled as\
  \ percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
