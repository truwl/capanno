description: "Asserts the validity for specified Illumina basecalling data.\nThis\
  \ tool will check that the basecall directory and the internal files are available,\
  \ exist, and are reasonably sized for every tile and cycle. Reasonably sized means\
  \ non-zero sized for files that exist per tile and equal size for binary files that\
  \ exist per cycle or per tile. If DATA_TYPES {Position, BaseCalls, QualityScores,\
  \ PF, or Barcodes} are not specified, then the default data types used by IlluminaBasecallsToSam\
  \ are used. CheckIlluminaDirectory DOES NOT check that the individual records in\
  \ a file are well-formed."
