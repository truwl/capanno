description: Not to be confused with SortSam which sorts a SAM or BAM file with a
  valid sequence dictionary, ReorderSam reorders reads in a SAM/BAM file to match
  the contig ordering in a provided reference file, as determined by exact name matching
  of contigs. Reads mapped to contigs absent in the new reference are dropped. Runs
  substantially faster if the input is an indexed BAM file.
