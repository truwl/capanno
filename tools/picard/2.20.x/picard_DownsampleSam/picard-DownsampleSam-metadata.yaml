description: 'Downsample a SAM or BAM file. This tool applies a random downsampling
  algorithm to a SAM or BAM file to retain only a random subset of the reads. Reads
  in a mate-pair are either both kept or both discarded. Reads marked as not primary
  alignments are all discarded. Each read is given a probability P of being retained
  so that runs performed with the exact same input in the same order and with the
  same value for RANDOM_SEED will produce the same results. All reads for a template
  are kept or discarded as a unit, with the goal of retaining readsfrom PROBABILITY
  * input templates. While this will usually result in approximately PROBABILITY *
  input reads being retained also, for very small PROBABILITIES this may not be the
  case. A number of different downsampling strategies are supported using the STRATEGY
  option: ConstantMemory: Downsamples a stream or file of SAMRecords using a hash-projection
  strategy such that it can run in constant memory. The downsampling is stochastic,
  and therefore the actual retained proportion will vary around the requested proportion.
  Due to working in fixed memory this strategy is good for large inputs, and due to
  the stochastic nature the accuracy of this strategy is highest with a high number
  of output records, and diminishes at low output volumes. HighAccuracy: Attempts
  (but does not guarantee) to provide accuracy up to a specified limit. Accuracy is
  defined as emitting a proportion of reads as close to the requested proportion as
  possible. In order to do so this strategy requires memory that is proportional to
  the number of template names in the incoming stream of reads, and will thus require
  large amounts of memory when running on large input files. Chained: Attempts to
  provide a compromise strategy that offers some of the advantages of both the ConstantMemory
  and HighAccuracy strategies. Uses a ConstantMemory strategy to downsample the incoming
  stream to approximately the desired proportion, and then a HighAccuracy strategy
  to finish. Works in a single pass, and will provide accuracy close to (but often
  not as good as) HighAccuracy while requiring memory proportional to the set of reads
  emitted from the ConstantMemory strategy to the HighAccuracy strategy. Works well
  when downsampling large inputs to small proportions (e.g. downsampling hundreds
  of millions of reads and retaining only 2%. Should be accurate 99.9% of the time
  when the input contains >= 50,000 templates (read names). For smaller inputs, HighAccuracy
  is recommended instead.'
