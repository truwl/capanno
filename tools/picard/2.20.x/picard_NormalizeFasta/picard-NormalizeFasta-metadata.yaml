description: Normalizes lines of sequence in a FASTA file to be of the same length.This
  tool takes any FASTA-formatted file and reformats the sequence to ensure that all
  of the sequence record lines are of the same length (with the exception of the last
  line). Although the default setting is 100 bases per line, a custom line_length
  can be specified by the user. In addition, record names can be truncated at the
  first instance of a whitespace character to ensure downstream compatibility.
