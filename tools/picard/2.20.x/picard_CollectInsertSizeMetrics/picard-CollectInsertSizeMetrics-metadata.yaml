description: "This tool provides useful metrics for validating library construction\
  \ including the insert size distribution and read orientation of paired-end libraries.\n\
  The expected proportions of these metrics vary depending on the type of library\
  \ preparation used, resulting from technical differences between pair-end libraries\
  \ and mate-pair libraries. For a brief primer on paired-end sequencing and mate-pair\
  \ reads, see the GATK Dictionary. The CollectInsertSizeMetrics tool outputs the\
  \ percentages of read pairs in each of the three orientations (FR, RF, and TANDEM)\
  \ as a histogram. In addition, the insert size distribution is output as both a\
  \ histogram (.insert_size_Histogram.pdf) and as a data table (.insert_size_metrics.txt).\n\
  Note: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
