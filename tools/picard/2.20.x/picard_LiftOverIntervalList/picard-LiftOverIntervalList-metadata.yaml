description: 'Lifts over an interval list from one reference build to another. This
  tool adjusts the coordinates in an interval list derived from one reference to match
  a new reference, based on a chain file that describes the correspondence between
  the two references. It is based on the UCSC liftOver tool (see: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver)
  and uses a UCSC chain file to guide its operation. It accepts both Picard interval_list
  files or VCF files as interval inputs.'
