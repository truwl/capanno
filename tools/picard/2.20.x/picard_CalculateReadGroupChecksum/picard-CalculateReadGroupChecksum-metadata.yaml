description: Creates a hash code based on the read groups (RG). This tool creates
  a hash code based on identifying information in the read groups (RG) of a ".BAM"
  or "SAM" file header. Addition or removal of RGs changes the hash code, enabling
  the user to quickly determine if changes have been made to the read group information.
