description: Verify mate-pair information between mates and fix if needed. This tool
  ensures that all mate-pair information is in sync between each read and its mate
  pair. If no OUTPUT file is supplied then the output is written to a temporary file
  and then copied over the INPUT file. Reads marked with the secondary alignment flag
  are written to the output file unchanged.
