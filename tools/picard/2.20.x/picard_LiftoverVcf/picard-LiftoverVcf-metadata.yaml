description: "Lifts over a VCF file from one reference build to another. This tool\
  \ adjusts the coordinates of variants within a VCF file to match a new reference.\
  \ The output file will be sorted and indexed using the target reference build. To\
  \ be clear, REFERENCE_SEQUENCE should be the target reference build. The tool is\
  \ based on the UCSC liftOver tool (see: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver)\
  \ and uses a UCSC chain file to guide its operation.\nNote that records may be rejected\
  \ because they cannot be lifted over or because of sequence incompatibilities between\
  \ the source and target reference genomes. Rejected records will be emitted with\
  \ filters to the REJECT file, using the source genome coordinates."
