description: Checks if all fingerprints within a set of files appear to come from
  the same individual. The fingerprints are calculated initially at the readgroup
  level (if present) but can be "rolled-up" by library, sample or file, to increase
  power and provide results at the desired resolution. Regular output is in a "Moltenized"
  format, one row per comparison. In this format the output will include the LOD score
  and also tumor-aware LOD score which can help assess identity even in the presence
  of a severe LOH sample with high purity. A matrix output is also available to facilitate
  visual inspection of crosscheck results. A separate CLP, ClusterCrosscheckMetrics,
  can cluster the results as a connected graph according to LOD greater than a threshold.
