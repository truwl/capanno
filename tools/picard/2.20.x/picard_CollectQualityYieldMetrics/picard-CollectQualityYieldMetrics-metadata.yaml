description: "Collect metrics about reads that pass quality thresholds and Illumina-specific\
  \ filters. This tool evaluates the overall quality of reads within a bam file containing\
  \ one read group. The output indicates the total numbers of bases within a read\
  \ group that pass a minimum base quality score threshold and (in the case of Illumina\
  \ data) pass Illumina quality filters as described in the GATK Dictionary entry.\n\
  Note on base quality score options If the quality score of read bases has been modified\
  \ in a previous data processing step such as GATK Base Recalibration and an OQ tag\
  \ is available, this tool can be set to use the OQ value instead of the primary\
  \ quality value for the evaluation.\nNote that the default behaviour of this program\
  \ changed as of November 6th 2015 to no longer include secondary and supplemental\
  \ alignments in the computation."
