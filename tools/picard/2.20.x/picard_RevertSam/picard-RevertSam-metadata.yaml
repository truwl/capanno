description: Reverts SAM or BAM files to a previous state. This tool removes or restores
  certain properties of the SAM records, including alignment information, which can
  be used to produce an unmapped BAM (uBAM) from a previously aligned BAM. It is also
  capable of restoring the original quality scores of a BAM file that has already
  undergone base quality score recalibration (BQSR) if theoriginal qualities were
  retained.
