description: "Collect jumping library metrics.\nThis tool collects high-level metrics\
  \ about the presence of outward-facing (jumping) and inward-facing (non-jumping)\
  \ read pairs within a SAM or BAM file. For a brief primer on jumping libraries,\
  \ see the GATK Dictionary.\nThis program gets all data for computation from the\
  \ first read in each pair in which the mapping quality (MQ) tag is set with the\
  \ mate's mapping quality. If the MQ tag is not set, then the program assumes that\
  \ the mate's MQ is greater than or equal to MINIMUM_MAPPING_QUALITY (default value\
  \ is 0).\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
