description: "Collects hybrid-selection (HS) metrics for a SAM or BAM file. This tool\
  \ takes a SAM/BAM file input and collects metrics that are specific for sequence\
  \ datasets generated through hybrid-selection. Hybrid-selection (HS) is the most\
  \ commonly used technique to capture exon-specific sequences for targeted sequencing\
  \ experiments such as exome sequencing; for more information, please see the corresponding\
  \ GATK Dictionary entry.\nThis tool requires an aligned SAM or BAM file as well\
  \ as bait and target interval files in Picard interval_list format. You should use\
  \ the bait and interval files that correspond to the capture kit that was used to\
  \ generate the capture libraries for sequencing, which can generally be obtained\
  \ from the kit manufacturer. If the baits and target intervals are provided in BED\
  \ format, you can convert them to the Picard interval_list format using Picard's\
  \ BedToInterval tool.\nIf a reference sequence is provided, this program will calculate\
  \ both AT_DROPOUT and GC_DROPOUT metrics. Dropout metrics are an attempt to measure\
  \ the reduced representation of reads, in regions that deviate from 50% G/C content.\
  \ This reduction in the number of aligned reads is due to the increased numbers\
  \ of errors associated with sequencing regions with excessive or deficient numbers\
  \ of G/C bases, ultimately leading to poor mapping efficiencies and lowcoverage\
  \ in the affected regions.\nIf you are interested in getting G/C content and mean\
  \ sequence depth information for every target interval, use the PER_TARGET_COVERAGE\
  \ option.\nNote: Metrics labeled as percentages are actually expressed as fractions!"
