description: "Collect metrics to assess oxidative artifacts. This tool collects metrics\
  \ quantifying the error rate resulting from oxidative artifacts. For a brief primer\
  \ on oxidative artifacts, see the GATK Dictionary.\nThis tool calculates the Phred-scaled\
  \ probability that an alternate base call results from an oxidation artifact. This\
  \ probability score is based on base context, sequencing read orientation, and the\
  \ characteristic low allelic frequency. Please see the following reference for an\
  \ in-depth discussion of the OxoG error rate.\nLower probability values implicate\
  \ artifacts resulting from 8-oxoguanine, while higher probability values suggest\
  \ that an alternate base call is due to either some other type of artifact or is\
  \ a real variant."
