description: "Merges multiple SAM and/or BAM files into a single file. This tool is\
  \ used for combining SAM and/or BAM files from different runs or read groups, similarly\
  \ to the \"merge\" function of Samtools (http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).\n\
  Note that to prevent errors in downstream processing, it is critical to identify/label\
  \ read groups appropriately. If different samples contain identical read group IDs,\
  \ this tool will avoid collisions by modifying the read group IDs to be unique.\
  \ For more information about read groups, see the GATK Dictionary entry."
