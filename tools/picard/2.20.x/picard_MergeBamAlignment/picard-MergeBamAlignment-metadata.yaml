description: Merge alignment data from a SAM or BAM with data in an unmapped BAM file.
  This tool produces a new SAM or BAM file that includes all aligned and unaligned
  reads and also carries forward additional read attributes from the unmapped BAM
  (attributes that are otherwise lost in the process of alignment). The purpose of
  this tool is to use information from the unmapped BAM to fix up aligner output.
  The resulting file will be valid for use by other Picard tools. For simple BAM file
  merges, use MergeSamFiles. Note that MergeBamAlignment expects to find a sequence
  dictionary in the same directory as REFERENCE_SEQUENCE and expects it to have the
  same base name as the reference FASTA except with the extension ".dict". If the
  output sort order is not coordinate, then reads that are clipped due to adapters
  or overlapping will not contain the NM, MD, or UQ tags.
